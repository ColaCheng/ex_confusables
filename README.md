# ExConfusables

Compares two strings if they are visually confusable as described in [Unicode® Technical Standard #39](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#Confusable_Detection): Both strings get transformed into a skeleton format before comparing them. The skeleton is generated by normalizing the string ([NFD](http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/#Norm_Forms)), replacing [confusable characters](https://unicode.org/Public/security/latest/confusables.txt), and normalizing the string again.

## Usage

### ExConfusables.confusable?/2

Check if two strings are confusable for each other.

```elixir
iex> ExConfusables.confusable?("ℰlixir", "Elixir")
     true
```

### ExConfusables.skeleton/1

Transforms a unicode string by replacing unusual characters with similar-looking common characters,
  as specified by the [Unicode Standard Annex #39](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/).

```elixir
iex> ExConfusables.skeleton("ℰlixir")
     "Elixir"
```
